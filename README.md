This Products page was made with MERN (Express.js, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB). 
Here, the Postman Api is used to store the products in MongoDB, and React is used to develop the frontend, which uses Node.js and Express.js to retrieve the product data from MongoDB.

You must create a Node modules folder in the frontend and a backend folder 
cd frontend
npm install

cd backend
npm install

âœ… Done!
