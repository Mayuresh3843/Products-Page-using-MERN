This Products page was made with MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). 
Here, the Postman Api stores the products in MongoDB, and React develops the front end, which uses Node.js and Express.js to retrieve the product data from MongoDB.

You must create a Node modules folder in the frontend and the backend folder. 
cd frontend
npm install

cd backend
npm install

âœ… Done!
